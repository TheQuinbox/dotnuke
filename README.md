Command line tool to get rid of macOS generated ._ files.

## Why?

```
macOS often times generates files/folders prepended by a ._. This is to store metadat information. However, these can get quite annoying if you're working with Windows or Linux. This simple CLI tool deletes all files and folders starting with ._.
